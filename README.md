# data_structure_and_algorithm

This project is to resolve problems using algorithms and exploring data structures

Solved Problems,
1.checking user given string is a palidrome or not
2.Get the result for a user given exponent /  two to the power value 

Use of the Data structures for real scenarios,
1. Adding elements and removing elements using array
